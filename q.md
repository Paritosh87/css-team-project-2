*the &lt;q&gt; tag represents the HTML quote element.*

Write a description here. Provide an overview of what the reference entry is, how it's used, it's significance, or how it's commonly used.
The html element `<q>` is used for short inline quotations.

## Syntax

Introduction to the syntax/usage. A example of CSS syntax is below:

```
<p>In Star Wars, Han Solo says <q cite="From the movie Star Wars: A New Hope">I've got a bad feeling about this</q> before the walls of the trash compactor start to close in.</p>
```
<p>In Star Wars, Han Solo says <q cite="From the movie Star Wars: A New Hope">I've got a bad feeling about this</q> before the walls of the trash compactor start to close in.</p>

### Attributes

This is a CSS example, so each value would need it's own sub-section below.

The `<q>` element can have a `cite` attribute. The cite attribute can be used by screen readers, but currently no normal browser displays or uses the `cite` attribute.

## Example 1

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
        background: green;
```

## Example 2

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
        background: url('path_to_image.png');
```

## Example 3 - Complex

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
        background: none 50% 25% auto contain fixed;
```

Add information that you found that seemed lesser known. Common bugs, obscure bugs, important distinctions, all belong in this section.
