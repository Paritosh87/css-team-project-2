#background-repeat

*Defines how the image in the `background-image` property should be repeated*

Write a description here. Provide an overview of what the reference entry is, how it's used, it's significance, or how it's commonly used.
The `background-repeat` propery defines whether the image set in the `background-image` property of an element should be repeated. If it is to be repeated, it will define whether it's repeated along the x, y, or both x and y axis. By default, background-repeat is set to repeat on both vertically and horizontally.

## Syntax

Introduction to the syntax/usage. A example of CSS syntax is below:

```
       background-repeat: repeat | repeat-x | repeat-y | no-repeat | initial | inherit;
```

### Values

The `background-repeat` property allows for different values. These values are:

#### repeat

`repeat` will cause the background image to be repeated both vertically and horizontally. This is the default behavior.

#### no-repeat

`no-repeat` will prevent the background image from being repeated

#### repeat-x

`repeat-x` will cause the background image to only be repeated along the x-axis

#### repeat-y

`repeat-y` will cause the background image to only be repeated along the y-axis

#### initial

`initial` will set the property to it's default value, in this case back to `repeat`.
